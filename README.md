Given an array of integers arr and an integer k, you need to perform the minimum number of operations to make all the elements in the array equal to k. In each operation, you can choose any element arr[i] and change it to any value between 1 and k (inclusive) by incrementing or decrementing the element's value.

You are required to return the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements in the array equal to k.
"
Example:
arr = [1, 3, 5, 7]
k = 3

Output: 3

3 unique elements than k.
